This is a project that shows the new year countdown clock using the Date library in Javascript. I used subtraction of milliseconds to find the days,hours,minutes and seconds.
I also used javascript to toggle the visibility of the other parts of my code when the preview button was clicked
The rest of the project talks about the best selling guitars of the year.
